    <string name="content1">The trouble is that innovation involves trying to hit a moving target. Environments constantly shift and pose new threats – new technologies appear, new markets emerge, the regulatory framework changes – and unless organizations have the capacity to innovate their approaches to innovation they may not survive in the long term. History is clear about this – very few organizations are long-term survivors and those which have managed to stick around for over 100 years have made some major changes to what they do and how they do it (Francis et al., 2003). Sometimes the changes are pretty dramatic, challenging the roots of where the company began and overturning a lot in the process. TUI, for example, is the largest European travel and tourism services company, owning (amongst others) Thomson Holidays, Britannia Airways, and Lunn Poly travel agents. Its origins, however, go back to 1917 where it began as the Prussian state-owned lead mining and smelting company! Nokia’s key role as a leader in mobile telephony hides its origins as a diverse timber products conglomerate with interests as wide as rubber boots and toilet paper!</string>
